# Using class to show students grades:
In this code, I used class List. I wrote two arrays in private and three functions in public, two of the functions are defined out of the class and one of them is declared in the class.<br/>
x array used for the grades of two students and Name array used for names of them. <br/>
Function Setmarks put the a array in x array.<br/>
Function Setnames put the b array in the Name array.<br/>
in the main function:<br/>
Get the name of two students from the user and put them in a array<br/>
Get the grades of two students from the user and put them in the p array<br/>
define the variable k in class type<br/>
Apply setmarks on p <br/>
Apply setnames on a<br/>
Apply display to show the result<br/>
